With over four years of comprehensive experience spanning roles as a Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, Software Engineer, and Data Analyst across esteemed organizations such as Outlier, New York Institute of Technology, Cleartax, and Zoho Company, I bring a robust skill set and a wealth of expertise in data analytics, machine learning, and software development. Armed with a Master's degree in Data Science from New York Institute of Technology and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Vel Tech University, I have consistently demonstrated proficiency in SQL, Python, Tableau, and a plethora of other tools and technologies vital for extracting actionable insights from complex datasets. Noteworthy projects include a detailed analysis of the medical equipment supply chain landscape and a Tableau dashboard project illuminating trends in the tech job market. Eager to leverage my skills and experiences to drive impactful analytics initiatives, I am keen on contributing to Walmart's data-driven decision-making processes as a Data Analyst.
